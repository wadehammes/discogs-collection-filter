# FilterMyDiscogs

FilterMyDisco.gs as it stands now is the beginning of a fully-featured Discogs collection management app. It was born out of the necessity to filter my collection by genre and sort by various criteria to prepare for an upcoming gig. Discogs unfortunately removes that ability for collections over a certain size (which is weird). Follow along on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nthoftype) for project updates.
